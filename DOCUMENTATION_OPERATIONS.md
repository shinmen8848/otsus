# Deployment & Operations Documentation

This document covers the procedures for building, deploying, and configuring the application.

## 1. Configuration

### 1.1. Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. A template for these variables is provided in `.env.example`. A `.env` file should be created in the root of the project with the following variables:

-   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of the Supabase project.
-   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The anonymous key for the Supabase project.
-   Other sensitive keys for AI services or other third-party integrations.

**Note**: The `VITE_` prefix is a convention used by Vite to expose environment variables to the frontend.

### 1.2. TypeScript Configuration

-   `tsconfig.json`: The base TypeScript configuration for the project.
-   `tsconfig.app.json`: TypeScript configuration specific to the React application code.
-   `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript configuration for the Node.js environment (e.g., for Vite's configuration files).

### 1.3. Build & Styling Configuration

-   `vite.config.ts`: The main configuration file for Vite, the build tool. It defines plugins, build output, and the development server.
-   `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, including theme customizations and plugins.
-   `postcss.config.js`: Configuration for PostCSS, which processes the CSS with plugins like `autoprefixer`.

## 2. Dependencies

Project dependencies are managed with `npm` or `bun`.

-   `package.json`: Lists all project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
-   `package-lock.json` / `bun.lockb`: Lock files that ensure consistent dependency installation across different environments.

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
bun install
```

## 3. Running the Application Locally

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a hot-reloading development server, typically available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 4. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
1.  Transpile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
2.  Bundle all assets (JS, CSS, images).
3.  Optimize the output for performance.

The production-ready files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

## 5. Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed to a modern hosting platform that supports SPAs and serverless functions.

### 5.1. Frontend (SPA)

The `dist/` directory, generated by the build process, can be deployed to any static hosting provider, such as:
-   Vercel
-   Netlify
-   AWS S3/CloudFront
-   GitHub Pages

### 5.2. Backend (Serverless Functions)

The serverless functions in the `app/api/` directory are intended to be deployed to a platform that supports this architecture. If using Next.js, Vercel is a natural choice. If using other frameworks, platforms like Netlify Functions, AWS Lambda, or Google Cloud Functions would be suitable.

Given the use of Supabase, the backend might also be deployed as Edge Functions on Supabase itself.

## 6. Testing

The project includes a testing setup.
-   **Directory**: `src/__tests__/`
-   **Tests**:
    -   `accessibility.test.tsx`: Tests for accessibility compliance.
    -   `color-grading.test.ts`: Unit tests for the color grading logic.
    -   `performance.test.ts`: Tests for application performance.

To run the tests, use the command defined in `package.json` (e.g., `npm test`).

This concludes the primary documentation for the application.
