# System Architecture & Technology Stack Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, technology stack, and core design patterns used in this application.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The application is a modern web application with a monolithic frontend and a serverless backend. It is designed to be a feature-rich, interactive, and performant user experience.

-   **Frontend**: A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React.
-   **Backend**: Serverless functions host the API endpoints.
-   **Database**: A relational database to store application data.
-   **AI Services**: Integrates with AI services for enhanced features.

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1. Frontend

-   **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (`v18+`)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **UI Components**: Custom-built components, likely using a library like `shadcn/ui`.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first CSS.
-   **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and optimized builds.

### 2.2. Backend

-   **Runtime**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with TypeScript.
-   **Framework**: The API routes are likely built using a framework like Next.js API Routes or a similar serverless function-as-a-service provider.
-   **API Style**: RESTful API for client-server communication.

### 2.3. Database

-   **Type**: SQL (from `database/schema.sql`). The specific engine is likely PostgreSQL or MySQL.
-   **ORM/Client**: A library like `node-postgres` or a custom DB client is used for database interactions.

### 2.4. AI & Machine Learning

-   **Providers**: The application seems to use custom AI models or a third-party AI provider for features like chat and context analysis.

## 3. Core Implementation Patterns

### 3.1. Component-Based Architecture

The frontend is structured around reusable React components, located in `src/components/`. This promotes modularity and maintainability. UI components are further organized into a `ui` subdirectory, suggesting a design system.

### 3.2. Serverless Functions

The backend logic is encapsulated in serverless functions located in `app/api/`. This approach allows for scalable, on-demand execution of backend code.

### 3.3. State Management

Given the complexity, a state management library (like Redux, Zustand, or React Context) is likely used to manage application state, although a specific one is not immediately obvious from the file structure alone.

### 3.4. Data Flow

1.  A user interacts with the UI (React components).
2.  Components dispatch actions or call hooks.
3.  These actions may trigger API calls to the backend.
4.  The backend processes the request, interacts with the database or AI services.
5.  The API returns a response to the frontend.
6.  The frontend updates its state and re-renders the UI.

## 4. Project Structure Overview

-   `app/`: Contains the backend API routes.
-   `src/`: The main source code for the React frontend.
-   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
-   `src/pages/`: Top-level page components.
-   `src/lib/`: Shared utility functions, services, and libraries.
-   `database/`: Database schema and migration files.
-   `public/`: Static assets accessible to the public.
