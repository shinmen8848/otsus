# Backend & API Documentation

This document describes the backend architecture, API endpoints, and data management for the application.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend is built using a serverless architecture, with API endpoints implemented as individual functions. This design is scalable, cost-effective, and easy to maintain.

-   **Runtime**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Location**: All backend code resides in the `app/api/` directory.

## 2. API Endpoints

The API follows a RESTful convention. The file-based routing in the `app/api/` directory defines the API endpoints.

### 2.1. AI Endpoints

-   **`app/api/ai/chat/conversations/route.ts`**
    -   **Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/chat/conversations`
    -   **Description**: Creates a new chat conversation.
    -   **Request Body**: Likely contains initial user message or metadata.
    -   **Response**: The newly created conversation object, including a unique ID.

-   **`app/api/ai/chat/messages/route.ts`**
    -   **Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/chat/messages`
    -   **Description**: Adds a new message to an existing conversation.
    -   **Request Body**: Should include `conversationId` and the message content.
    -   **Response**: The newly created message object.

-   **`app/api/ai/context/route.ts`**
    -   **Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/context`
    -   **Description**: Provides contextual information to the AI, possibly for summarization or analysis.
    -   **Request Body**: The text or data to be processed.
    -   **Response**: The AI-generated context or analysis.

## 3. Database

### 3.1. Schema (`database/schema.sql`)

The database schema is defined in `database/schema.sql`. This file contains the `CREATE TABLE` statements and defines the structure of the application's data. A full review of this file is necessary to understand the complete data model.

### 3.2. Database Interaction

-   **`src/lib/database.ts`**: This module likely contains the core database connection logic and query functions.
-   **`src/lib/supabase.ts`**: This suggests that [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) is being used as the backend-as-a-service provider, which would handle database access, authentication, and potentially other backend services. The functions in this file would wrap the Supabase client.

## 4. Data Flow

1.  The frontend client makes an HTTP request to one of the API endpoints (e.g., `/api/ai/chat/messages`).
2.  The serverless function corresponding to the route is invoked.
3.  The function processes the request, validates input, and interacts with the database via the `database.ts` or `supabase.ts` modules.
4.  For AI-related tasks, the function communicates with the relevant AI services.
5.  The function returns a JSON response to the client.
6.  The client receives the response and updates the UI accordingly.

## 5. Security & Authentication

While not explicitly detailed in the file structure, a modern application of this nature would implement robust security measures. If using Supabase, this would likely include:

-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authenticating API requests.
-   **Row-Level Security (RLS)** in the database to ensure users can only access their own data.
-   **Environment variables** to store sensitive keys and credentials (e.g., in a `.env` file, based on the `.env.example`).
